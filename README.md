Here is a test that I was requested to finish project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Then, the page for generating QR code will be shown, users can enter the personal info, but the timestamp needs to be generated by submitting the form.
