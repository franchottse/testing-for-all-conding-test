Here is a test that I was requested to finish project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all the necessary packages by:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

After installing packages, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Then, the page for generating QR code will be shown, users can enter the personal info, but the timestamp will be generated by submitting the form.
